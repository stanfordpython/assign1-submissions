1) How long did this assignment take you to complete?
7 hours


2) What has been the best part of the class so far?
The interactive labs




3) What can we do to make this class more enjoyable for you?
This homework felt like a bit of harsh ramp in difficulty, especially the
railfence cipher. I couldn't quite get the algorithm down, and implementing it
using slices and list comprehension would have made it much more confusing for
me.




4) What types of assignments would excite you in this class?
More projects like these, but maybe a bit more guidance?
