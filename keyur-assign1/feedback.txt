1) How long did this assignment take you to complete?

Around 5 and a half hours. Majority of the time on the railfence algorithm!


2) What has been the best part of the class so far?

Loved the pace so far and think Sam is teaching incredibly relevant material.

3) What can we do to make this class more enjoyable for you?

It would be great to get "real world applications" stuff from the class as well. We could talk 
about what Python is used for in the real world (as in personal projects, apps, websites...etc.) And
then in lab, we could go over a real example. 

4) What types of assignments would excite you in this class?

Similar to my previous answer, I'd love a real world assignment where we are scraping data from the web or
writing scripts that automate something useful!

Thank you guys so much for all the work you've been putting into the class. Its already been one of my 
most enjoyable academic experiences and its only been 3 weeks. Thought this assignment went a long way in 
confirming basic control of Python which was perfect. Thanks again.
