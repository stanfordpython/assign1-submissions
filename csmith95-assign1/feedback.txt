1) How long did this assignment take you to complete?
… I didn’t really have time to complete railfence decryption, but I spent about 2 hours on the parts before railfence and 4 hours thinking about railfence.


2) What has been the best part of the class so far?
I like the in-class lab days (the only days 2 days I’ve been in class were lab days). Doing the problems with a partner is more fun.




3) What can we do to make this class more enjoyable for you?
I’m not sure because I’ve only been to 2 classes, but I like the relaxed feel of the class. It feels very low stress, which is rare for a CS class.




4) What types of assignments would excite you in this class?

I liked this encryption assignment. A web-based assignment would be cool.
