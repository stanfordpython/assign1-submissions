I've really enjoyed the class style. Good lectures and the labs are fun, as well as a 106-series feel to the work so far.

3) What can we do to make this class more enjoyable for you?
Class has been great! No suggestions.

4) What types of assignments would excite you in this class?
I'd really like to see what applications of python make it exceptional. Like flipping the string with [::-1] is super cool, what else can python do like that.
