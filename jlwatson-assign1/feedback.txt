1) How long did this assignment take you to complete?
It took me about 5 or 6 hours, mostly because I got a little stuck on the Railfence algorithm and I spent some good amount of time trying to decrypt one of the vigenere file with the wrong key :D

2) What has been the best part of the class so far?
Definitely the help in class - during both the lectures and the labs, it's really nice to be able to get a second look at a problem or attempt at writing code.




3) What can we do to make this class more enjoyable for you?
Keep up the good work!




4) What types of assignments would excite you in this class?
I'm really excited to work on whatever assignments you come up with, but maybe something that edits sound waves/music to get some cool effects.
