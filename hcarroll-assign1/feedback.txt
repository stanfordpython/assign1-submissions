1) How long did this assignment take you to complete?
Too long…. and it’s not completed.
Probably 7 hours to do what I’ve done, but mostly because rail fence gave me such misery. Sorry I didn’t finish it! 
I’d like to see a solution, though, so I know how I can do it in the future. I also wonder how far off my logic was; if I was close with logic but the syntax was messing me up, I think i’ll feel better.


2) What has been the best part of the class so far?
Learning Python! The assignment was pretty fun, actually, except for the debugging issues I ran into. I also like how it’s pass/fail - it’s low stress, so I can actually enjoy the learning and enjoy the assignments. I feel like I’m actually getting more out of the class that way.



3) What can we do to make this class more enjoyable for you?
Not sure; maybe move a TINY bit slower? It’s been pretty great so far. I like the lab.



4) What types of assignments would excite you in this class?
This one was great! I think you have the right idea in mind. However, maybe a bit shorter… railfence was very difficult for a lot of people, and took a long time.

Thanks for all your help, guys! You’re awesome teachers.
